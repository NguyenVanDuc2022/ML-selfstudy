There are 15 ways to work with statistics in Python (numpy).

1. Vector mean.
2. Matrix means.
3. Vector variance.
4. Matrix variances.
5. Matrix standard deviation.
6. Vector covariance.
7. Vector correlation.
8. Covariance matrix.
9. Principal component analysis.
10. Principle component analysis with scikit-learn.
11. Linear regression dataset.
12. Direct solution to linear least squares.
13. QR decomposition solution to linear least squares.
14. SVD solution via pseudoinverse to linear least squares.
15. Least squares via convenience function.
